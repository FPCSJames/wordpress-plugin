Easily send email from your WordPress site through Mailgun using the HTTP API or SMTP.


== Description ==

[Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com/) is the email automation engine trusted by over 10,000 website and application developers for sending, receiving and tracking emails. By taking advantage of Mailgun's powerful email APIs, developers can spend more time building awesome websites and less time fighting with email servers. Mailgun supports all of the most popular languages including PHP, Ruby, Python, C# and Java.

One particularly useful feature of this plugin is that it provides you with a way to send email when the server you are on does not support SMTP or where outbound SMTP is restricted since the plug-in uses the Mailgun HTTP API for sending email by default. All you need to use the plugin is a [Mailgun account](http://www.mailgun.com/). Mailgun has a free account that lets you send up to 200 emails per day, which is great for testing. Paid subscriptions are available for increased limits.

The latest version of this plugin adds support for Mailgun list subscription. Using the shortcode, you can place a form on an article or page to allow the visitor to subscribe to one or more lists. Using the widget, you can provide subscription functionality in sidebars or anywhere widgets are supported e.g. footers.

The current version of this plugin only handles sending emails, tracking and tagging and list subscription.
